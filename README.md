# Memedows
memedows is a project built for my stream http://twitch.tv/jdudetv. To run a bunch of interactive and automated elements in the broadcast for my viewers and myself.

# Packages
    - Client: Electron app that communicates with OBS
    - Functions: All cloud based code & configurations
    - Dashboard: User-facing React app

# FFMPEG
Hard coded the file name for ffmpeg shit in ffmpeg.ts because webpack sucks and changed __dirname to some other shit.
